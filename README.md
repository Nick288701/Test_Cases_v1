Automation Testing for the Practice Test Automation Website

This project utilizes Cypress to develop comprehensive end-to-end tests for the utilities on the testing sites homepage https://practice.expandtesting.com/, focusing on a wide range of interactions including number, text, password, and date input fields, form submission, validations, placeholder checks, maximum length enforcement, responsiveness across different viewport sizes, and clear button functionality. The initiative addresses challenges such as ad-related JavaScript errors by implementing a custom setViewport command to set a standard resolution, ensuring stable test execution. Future plans include expanding the test suite to cover additional sections like "Test Login Page," "Dynamic Table," and other sample applications, while continuously refining the automation process based on encountered issues.
Development Progress: The "Web Inputs" tests have been successfully stabilized with the viewport adjustment, and ongoing efforts are focused on troubleshooting and integrating tests for other sections, with collaboration from the xAI Grok assistant to debug and optimize the automation workflow.
